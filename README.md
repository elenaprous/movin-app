## About the project

MOVIN is a web app for home searchers to quickly get an overview of a location based on personalized preferences.

The idea was born in the Netherlands, where 1.8 million Dutch families don't consider their home to be ideal, but finding one that is seems like a mission impossible. That's where MOVIN comes in, by giving the application an address and your definitions of what makes a house a home, it will show you pros and cons of living in that area, tailoring these results to what you consider important. With a dashboard displaying a list of all your searches, ordering them by which one has the best rating, it is easy to compare options and make an assertive decision.

### How to use MOVIN

Simply access the website and throw an address in there! You will be onboarded to the platform and within two steps the results show up. From that point on you can search however many places you would like.

Check out the video demo of the application:
